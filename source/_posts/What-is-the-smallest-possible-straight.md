#  What is the smallest possible straight?

The answer to this question is a little more complex than it first appears. The answer depends on what is meant by "straight." For example, is a straight line one that has no curves or bends in it? Or is it simply a line that isn't crooked?

If we take the definition of straight as meaning "a line with no curves or bends in it," then the smallest possible straight would be a line consisting of only one point. This line would be as thin as possible and would have no width.

If we take the definition of straight as meaning "a line that isn't crooked," then the smallest possible straight would be a line that is perfectly linear, with no curves or bends. This line could be either very thin or very wide, depending on how precise we want our definition to be.

#  What is the difference between a flush and a full house?

There are two main types of poker hands: flush and full house. A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, whereas a full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.

The difference between these two hands lies in their ranking. Flushes always beat full houses, regardless of the ranks of the individual cards within each hand. This is because a flush contains more combined suits than a full house, meaning it is more likely to occur.

That said, there are some exceptions to this rule. If two players have flushes with different suits, the player with the highest ranking card within their flush will win. In the same way, if two players have full houses with different ranks, the player with the highest ranked three-of-a-kind will win.

#  What are the odds of being dealt two pair?

When playing poker, most players are primarily concerned with the hand they are dealt and how that hand can help them win the game. However, there is another important factor to consider: the odds of being dealt a particular hand. This information can help you make more informed decisions while playing and give you a better idea of the chances of winning or losing a particular hand.

In this article, we will take a look at the odds of being dealt two pair. What are the chances of being dealt two pair? What are the best hands to chase after if you want to try and form two pair? We will answer these questions and more below.

To begin with, let's take a look at what two pair actually is. In poker, two pair is when you have two cards of the same rank and two other cards of a different rank. For example, if you were dealt two Kings and two Queens, you would have two pair. This would be written as (KKQQ).

Now that we know what two pair is, let's take a look at the odds of being dealt this particular hand. The odds of being dealt two pair depend on the number of players in the game, as well as the deck composition. However, in general, the odds range from 1/36 (or about 2.8%) to 1/240 (or about 0.4%).

So what are the best hands to chase after if you want to try and form two pair? In general, any hand with a rank greater than 6 is worth chasing after. So for example, if you were dealt 3s 4s 5s 6s 7s (3456), you would want to continue playing in hopes of getting another 6 or 7 to form two pair. Hands with ranks lower than 6 are not typically worth chasing after since your chances of improving your hand are relatively low.

Now that we know all about two pair, let's put this information into practice by playing some hands ourselves!

#  In which situations can you declare yourself to be on a pat poker hand?

There are a few general guidelines you can follow to help figure out when you can declare yourself to be on a pat poker hand. The first guideline is to make sure that all of your cards are visible to all of the other players. If you are playing in a game with friends and family, this is not usually a problem, but in a casino or tournament setting, it may be more difficult to ensure that all of your cards are visible.

The second guideline is to make sure that all of the other players have had an opportunity to see your cards. This usually means that you should wait until it is your turn before declaring a pat hand. Again, this guideline can be more difficult to follow in casino or tournament settings where there may be many players acting at once.

The third and final guideline is to make sure that the other players agree that the hand is pat. This one can be a little trickier because it depends on the personalities of the players involved and how well they know each other. Generally speaking, though, if all of the players can see each other's cards and agree that the hand cannot be improved, then they can declare the hand to be pat.

#  If I am playing Texas Hold'em and my opponent goes all-in, can I call to see their cards, even if I do not have enough chips to cover their bet?

In Texas Hold'em, if you are playing against someone who has already gone all-in, you can call their bet even if you do not have enough chips to cover the amount they have wagered. This is because the all-in bet constitutes a final bet, and the hand will be played out regardless of whether or not you have the funds to pay it.

If you are playing against multiple opponents and one of them goes all-in, you can still call, but you will only be able to see the cards of the player who has gone all-in. The other players still in the hand will not reveal their cards.
