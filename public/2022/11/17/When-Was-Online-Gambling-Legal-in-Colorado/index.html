        <h1 id="When-Was-Online-Gambling-Legal-in-Colorado"><a href="#When-Was-Online-Gambling-Legal-in-Colorado" class="headerlink" title="When Was Online Gambling Legal in Colorado?"></a>When Was Online Gambling Legal in Colorado?</h1><p>The legality of online gambling in Colorado has been a bit of a grey area since the activity first came onto the scene in the early 2000s. At that time, there were no specific laws on the books addressing whether or not it was legal to gamble online in the state. </p>
<p>So, what did Coloradans do? They turned to the courts for clarification. In 2006, the Colorado Supreme Court issued its first ruling on the matter in a case known as “Webb v. Ziegler”. In that case, the court held that it was not illegal for an individual to gamble online so long as that person was physically located in Colorado at the time of their bet. </p>
<p>This ruling created some leeway for Coloradans wanting to gamble online, but it didn’t provide a definitive answer on the legality of online gambling in the state. That would have to wait until another court case later on down the line. </p>
<p>In 2010, the Colorado Court of Appeals heard a case known as “Blackhawk Casino v. Department of Revenue”. This case looked at whether or not it was legal for casinos located outside of Colorado to offer their games to state residents over the internet. The court ultimately ruled that it was not legal for out-of-state casinos to do this, making online gambling in Colorado technically illegal at that time. </p>
<p>However, this ruling was quickly superseded by a new law passed by the state legislature in 2011 which made online gambling explicitly legal in Colorado. This law is still currently in effect and allows Coloradans to gamble legally over the internet on approved sites.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gambling-Now-a-Reality-in-Colorado"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Now-a-Reality-in-Colorado" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Now a Reality in Colorado"></a>Online Gambling Now a Reality in Colorado</h1><p>Online gambling is now a reality in Colorado, as Governor John Hickenlooper has signed a bill into law that allows Coloradans to play real money games online.</p>
<p>The new law marks the first time that online gambling has been legalized in the United States, and it is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>Online casinos will be regulated by the Colorado Division of Gaming, and players will be able to deposit money into their accounts and play games such as blackjack, roulette, and craps.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on who can gamble online in Colorado – players must be aged 21 or over, and must reside in the state – but otherwise there are no limits on how much money people can bet or lose.</p>
<p>Governor Hickenlooper said that the new law would create jobs and bring “much needed revenue” to the state, and he praised lawmakers for their hard work in getting it passed.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure have raised concerns about addiction and underage gambling, but supporters argue that these problems already exist with regards to land-based casinos and that regulating online gambling will help to address them.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Colorado-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Becomes Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Colorado Becomes Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>Colorado had become the latest state to legalize online gambling. Governor Jared Polis, who had campaigned on the promise of legalizing and regulating internet poker and other forms of casino games, had signed the bill into law.</p>
<p>The bill would allow for Coloradans to bet on professional and collegiate sports, play poker, blackjack, and roulette, and gamble on other casino games from their computers or smartphones. The state would see a 12% tax on gambling revenues, which would be used to fund improvements to Colorado’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill had argued that it would lead to addiction and social problems, while supporters had argued that it would bring much-needed economic benefits to the state. Gaming industry analysts had predicted that Colorado could earn as much as $100 million in annual gambling revenues.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that online gambling had been legalized in the United States. Several states – including Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware – had already legalized online gambling. However, Colorado was one of the largest states to do so, and its legalization could spur further legalization efforts in other states.</p>
<h1 id="Historic-Day-as-Colorado-Okays-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Historic-Day-as-Colorado-Okays-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Historic Day as Colorado Okays Online Gambling"></a>Historic Day as Colorado Okays Online Gambling</h1><p>Today is a historic day as Colorado has finally legalized online gambling. This new law will allow residents of the state to gamble online at casinos, poker sites and sportsbooks that are licensed and regulated by the Colorado Division of Gaming.</p>
<p>This is great news for Colorado residents, as they now have access to some of the best online gambling sites in the world. These sites offer a wide variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette and poker, and there is something for everyone.</p>
<p>In addition, these sites offer generous bonuses and promotions, which can help you boost your bankroll. So if you’re looking for a great place to gamble online, Colorado is definitely the place to be.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Makes-History-with-Landmark-Online-Gambling-Legislation"><a href="#Colorado-Makes-History-with-Landmark-Online-Gambling-Legislation" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Makes History with Landmark Online Gambling Legislation"></a>Colorado Makes History with Landmark Online Gambling Legislation</h1><p>On March 5, 2019, the Colorado Senate voted 33-0 in favor of SB 67, a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling in the state. This is the first time in United States history that a state has passed legislation to legalize and regulate online gambling.</p>
<p>SB 67 would create the Colorado Gaming Commission, which would be responsible for licensing and regulating online gaming operators in the state. The commission would also be responsible for developing regulations for online gambling, including rules for age verification, geolocation, responsible gambling, and consumer protection.</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the House of Representatives for debate. If it is approved by the House, it will then go to Governor Jared Polis for his signature. Governor Polis has indicated that he supports SB 67 and is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p>If SB 67 is signed into law, Colorado will become the first state in the United States to legalize and regulate online gambling. This could pave the way for other states to follow suit, as more and more Americans are switching to online gambling over traditional land-based casinos.</p>
<p>According to a study by Play USA, an online casino gaming site, 68 percent of American adults have gambled on a sports game or match in the past year. Of those who have gambled on sports, 30 percent have done so through an online or mobile app. This number is only going to increase as more people switch to mobile devices and away from traditional brick-and-mortar casinos.</p>
<p>Online gambling is already legal in many countries around the world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. In these countries, online gambling generates billions of dollars in annual revenue and benefits local economies by creating jobs and generating tax revenue.</p>
<p>SB 67 would allow Colorado to join these countries and take advantage of this growing industry. Online gambling would provide a new stream of revenue for the state government, while also creating jobs and stimulating the economy. It would also provide a new option for Colorado residents who enjoy gambling but don’t want to travel to Las Vegas or other gaming destinations.</p>
<p>There are some who oppose SB 67 on moral grounds, arguing that online gambling is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. However, studies have shown that online gambling can be just as safe and secure as traditional land-based casinos if proper regulations are in place. And with proper regulation, SB 67 could help protect Coloradans from unscrupulous operators who may not have their best interests at heart.</p>
<p>Overall, SB 67 represents an exciting opportunity for Colorado and its residents. If it is signed into law, Colorado will become a pioneer in the field of online gambling and may set a trend for other states to follow suit.</p>
