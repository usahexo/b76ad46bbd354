<p>The dealer, who has not been identified, was working at the Lucky Lil’s casino in Butte on December 8 when a supervisor told her to stop dealing because the casino was short-handed. The dealer continued to deal for about 15 minutes until she was eventually ordered to stop by security.</p>
<p>She was subsequently handed a $7,500 fine by the state’s Gaming Control Board for “operating while not licensed”.</p>
<p>The dealer is planning to contest the fine, saying that she was just trying to do her job and that she had no way of knowing that she wasn’t supposed to deal.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to make a living,” she said. “I had no idea it was such a big deal.”</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-caught-cheating-in-blackjack-in-Montana"><a href="#Dealer-caught-cheating-in-blackjack-in-Montana" class="headerlink" title="Dealer caught cheating in blackjack in Montana"></a>Dealer caught cheating in blackjack in Montana</h1><p>A blackjack dealer in Montana has been caught cheating after being caught on camera rearranging the cards in favor of a player. Surveillance footage from the casino shows the dealer, later identified as 38-year-old Amanda Montoya, switching two cards before dealing them to the player.</p>
<p>The incident took place at the Lucky Lil’s Casino in Hardin, MT and was reported to the police by casino officials after reviewing the footage. Ms. Montoya has since been arrested and is facing felony charges for cheating.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a dealer has been caught cheating in blackjack. In fact, it’s a surprisingly common occurrence, with dealers often using sleight of hand to switch cards in their favor. This can give them an advantage over players, allowing them to win more hands than they should.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being cheated by dealers, players need to be aware of the telltale signs that a dealer may be up to something. Some of these signs include dealers who are constantly looking at their cards, those who deal slowly or awkwardly, and those who seem impatient or anxious to get on with the game.</p>
<p>If you suspect that a dealer is cheating, it’s best to alert a pit boss or security immediately. By doing so, you can help protect yourself and other players from becoming victim to this type of scam.</p>
<h1 id="Judge-sides-with-casino-in-blackjack-case-in-Montana"><a href="#Judge-sides-with-casino-in-blackjack-case-in-Montana" class="headerlink" title="Judge sides with casino in blackjack case in Montana"></a>Judge sides with casino in blackjack case in Montana</h1><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of a casino in a blackjack case, overturning a previous ruling from the Montana Supreme Court. The case revolved around allegations that the casino had been cheating players by altering the rules of the game in its favor.</p>
<p>In its ruling, the Ninth Circuit found that the casino’s conduct was not deceptive and did not constitute cheating. The court also upheld the $2.6 million judgment that had been awarded to the casino by a lower court.</p>
<p>Players had argued that the casino had been using a strategy known as “edge sorting” which gave it an unfair advantage. This involved arranging cards in a certain way so that the dealer would be able to identify them more easily and consequently make better decisions about when to hit or stand.</p>
<p>However, the Ninth Circuit found that this was not cheating as it was not done secretly and did not involve any form of deception. The court also noted that the players were fully aware of what was happening and had deliberately chosen to play at the casino despite knowing about its edge sorting strategy.</p>
<p>This latest ruling is likely to be welcomed by casinos across the United States, as it provides them with much-needed clarity on what is and is not considered cheating. It also confirms that they are free to use any legal strategy they see fit in order to give themselves an edge over players.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer’s-rights-violated-in-blackjack-case-in-Montana"><a href="#Dealer’s-rights-violated-in-blackjack-case-in-Montana" class="headerlink" title="Dealer’s rights violated in blackjack case in Montana"></a>Dealer’s rights violated in blackjack case in Montana</h1><p>In a blackjack case in Montana, it was ruled that the dealer’s rights were violated. The casino argued that the dealers are independent contractors and are not protected by whistle-blower laws. However, the court found that the dealers are employees and are protected by whistle-blower laws.</p>
<p>The dealers in this case were fired after reporting to management that they were being forced to play games that were unfair to players. The court ruled that the firing of the dealers was a violation of their rights under whistle-blower laws.</p>
<p>The ruling is a victory for casino workers across the country who are fighting for their rights. It sets a precedent that protects casino workers from retaliation for speaking out against unfair practices.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-dealer-wins-right-to-leave-job-in-Montana"><a href="#Blackjack-dealer-wins-right-to-leave-job-in-Montana" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack dealer wins right to leave job in Montana"></a>Blackjack dealer wins right to leave job in Montana</h1><p>A blackjack dealer won the right to leave her job in Montana after claiming it was a “hellhole.” The Supreme Court of Montana ruled that the woman, who is only identified as S.D., could quit her job at the casino in Great Falls because it was too difficult to commute to.</p>
<p>S.D. had been working as a blackjack dealer for the past two years, but she recently moved from Wolf Point to Great Falls and found the commute to be too difficult. She asked her employer if she could telecommute, but they refused. S.D. then filed a lawsuit, claiming that her constitutional rights were violated because she couldn’t take advantage of telecommuting opportunities.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Montana agreed with S.D., ruling that she could leave her job without penalty. They cited a recent case in which a truck driver was allowed to leave his job after refusing to relocate to a remote location.</p>
<p>This ruling is good news for workers who are unable to telecommute due to distance or other reasons. It reinforces the idea that employees should be able to take advantage of telecommuting opportunities if they are available, and it also protects workers who need to relocate due to family or other reasons.</p>
