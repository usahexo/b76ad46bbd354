#  Tax experts weigh in on the duty rate for casino winnings

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has released its proposed revised gaming duty rates for casino winnings, and there is much speculation on what the new tax rates will be.

"We don't have a lot of information yet," says accountant Sean Fayad. "But it's clear that the CRA is trying to reduce the amount of tax avoidance associated with gambling."

The CRA has not released any details on the proposed changes, but speculation is that the new rate for casino winnings will be in the range of 15-25%.

"It's important to remember that these are just proposals at this point," notes Fayad. "And there will be a lot of discussion and debate before anything is finalized."

Many experts are urging Canadians to speak up and share their thoughts on the proposed changes.

"This is a huge change, and it's going to affect a lot of people," says accounting professor Cynthia Koot. "We need to make sure that we get it right."

#  Canada Revenue Agency releases guidance on the treatment of casino winnings

On October 3, 2017, the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) released guidance on the tax treatment of casino winnings (the “Guidance”). The Guidance supersedes prior interpretations issued by the CRA in respect of the taxation of casino winnings, and provides clarity on a number of key issues.

The first issue addressed by the Guidance is the characterization of casino winnings as taxable either as income or capital gains. The CRA confirmed that all Casino winnings are taxable as income, with no exceptions. This is consistent with the CRA’s previously stated position that all gambling income is included in income for tax purposes.

The Guidance also provides clarity on when taxpayers are required to report their casino winnings. Generally, taxpayers must report their casino winnings in the year in which they are received. However, where a taxpayer incurs gambling losses in the same year as their casino wins, they are entitled to deduct those losses from their gross income to arrive at their net gambling income for tax purposes. This deduction is available whether or not the taxpayer reports their winnings on their tax return.

In addition to clarifying when taxpayers are required to report their casino winnings, the Guidance also provides guidance on how to calculate those winnings for tax purposes. In particular, it outlines how to calculate gross revenue (i.e., total amount wagered minus total amount paid back to players), net revenue (gross revenue minus allowable expenses), and taxable income (net revenue minus personal exemptions and deductions). The CRA has also released a new worksheet titled “Casino Winnings Tax Calculation” which taxpayers can use to calculate their taxable income from casino winnings.

Finally, the Guidance addresses a number of other issues related to the taxation of casino winnings, including what constitutes an allowable expense, foreign currency exchange rates, and late filing penalties and interest charges.

#  Are you paying too much tax on your casino winnings?

Casino winnings are considered taxable income in most countries around the world. This means that, no matter how much you win, you will have to pay tax on it. In some cases, the amount of tax you have to pay can be quite large, leaving you with a reduced amount of money from your winnings.

Fortunately, there are ways to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay on your casino winnings. One way is to claim your gambling losses as a deduction against your winnings. This can significantly reduce the amount of tax you have to pay.

Another way to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay is by choosing a casino that is located in a country with low taxes. Gibraltar and Malta are two examples of countries with low taxes on casino winnings. By playing at a casino in one of these countries, you can reduce the amount of tax you have to pay on your winnings.

If you want to take things one step further, you can create a company that operates as a casino in one of these countries. By doing this, you can take advantage of even lower taxes on casino winnings. This can be a great way to keep more of your money after winning at the casino.

There are many different ways to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay on your casino winnings. By using one or more of these methods, you can keep more of your hard-earned money in your pocket.

#  New report sheds light on the tax treatment of casino winnings in Canada

A new report from the Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF) has shed light on the tax treatment of casino winnings in Canada. According to the report, taxpayers who win more than $1,000 at a casino are required to pay tax on their winnings, even if they don't receive any money.

"Canadian taxpayers are being unfairly targeted by the CRA when it comes to gambling income," said CTF Federal Director Aaron Wudrick. "The rules governing casino wins are draconian and out-of-touch with reality."

Wudrick noted that the tax rules for casino winnings are different than those for other forms of gambling, such as lotteries and online gambling. For example, taxpayers who win more than $500 playing the lottery or online gambling are not required to pay tax on their winnings.

"The fact that someone who wins a jackpot at a casino can be taxed on their good luck while someone who wins the same amount playing slots in an online casino is not taxed is simply ridiculous," said Wudrick.

The CTF report also notes that many taxpayers are unaware of the tax rules for casino winnings, and that the CRA has been increasingly cracking down on people who don't report their winnings. In 2017, the CRA collected nearly $17 million in taxes from individuals who won more than $1,000 at a casino.

Wudrick called on the federal government to reform the rules for taxing casino winnings, saying that they are unfair and out-of-date. "It's time for Ottawa to treat Canadians fairly when it comes to gambling income," he said.

#  Get the latest news on the duty rate for casino winnings

Casino winnings are currently subject to a 33 percent duty rate. However, this may change in the near future.

The government is currently considering a proposal that would reduce the duty rate on casino winnings to 20 percent. This would be a welcome change for casino players, who have long complained about the high duty rate.

If the proposal is approved, it is likely that the duty rate will be reduced in early 2019. This means that players will need to keep an eye on the latest news to ensure they pay the correct amount of tax.

In addition to the proposed reduction in the duty rate, there are also rumours that the government may abolish the duty altogether. This would be a major victory for casino players, and it is something that they should keep an eye on in the coming months.

It is important to note that any changes to the duty rate are still subject to approval by parliament. However, with casino winnings generating millions of dollars in tax revenue each year, it is likely that any proposed changes will be given serious consideration by lawmakers.
