#  Bingo Night in Haiti Raises Money for Earthquake Relief

On February 1st, a bingo night was organized by students at the University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince. The event was held in order to raise money for earthquake relief efforts in the country.

The night was a huge success, with over 100 people in attendance. Bingo players competed for prizes that were donated by local businesses. In total, over 2,000 Haitian gourdes (approximately $45 US) were raised.

This money will be used to support the reconstruction efforts in Haiti. Many people were killed or injured in the earthquake that struck the country in January 2010, and much work remains to be done.

The bingo event was organized by a group of students known as APAH (Action Pour les Aveugles et les Handicapés). This group is dedicated to helping people with disabilities in Haiti.

APAH has been active since 2007, and has organized many different projects to help those in need. The organization is also involved in fundraising efforts to support its work.

We would like to congratulate APAH on this latest success, and thank them for their dedication to helping those affected by the earthquake in Haiti.

#  Haitian-Americans Hold Bar Bingo to Help Quake Victims

A group of Haitian-American bar and restaurant owners in Brooklyn, New York, are holding a bar bingo night as part of an effort to raise money for victims of the devastating earthquake in their home country.

The fundraiser is set to take place on Thursday, January 21 at Iguana Sports Bar & Grill in Flatbush and will include food, drinks, and games of chance.

“We just wanted to do something to help out the people who are suffering down there,” said event organizer Tony Dejean. “We know that everybody is doing what they can to help, but we thought this would be a way for us to contribute as well.”

All proceeds from the evening will go directly to support relief efforts in Haiti. So far, the organizers have managed to raise over $1,000 for the cause.

In addition to raising money, the organizers are also hoping to bring attention to the plight of the Haitian people following the disaster.

“A lot of people don’t even know that Haiti was hit so hard by this quake,” Dejean said. “We want to let them know what’s going on and how they can help.”

If you are in the New York City area and would like to show your support for Haiti, please consider attending Iguana Sports Bar & Grill on January 21st for a night of fun and fundraising.
