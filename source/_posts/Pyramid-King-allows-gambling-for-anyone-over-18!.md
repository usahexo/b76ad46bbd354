#  Legal gambling in Pyramid King for 3 days only!

Greetings, my fellow Gamers!

I am proud to announce that the legal gambling in Pyramid King is now open for 3 days only starting from today! Get your luck on and compete with other Gamers to see who is the Pyramid King!

For those of you who are not familiar with Pyramid King, it is a puzzle game that simulates a pyramid treasure hunt. The objective is to collect as many treasures as possible by uncovering tiles in a pyramid. Be careful though, as one wrong move could cost you the game!

The gambling in Pyramid King is simple. There are three treasures in the pyramid, and each treasure is worth a different amount of points. You can gamble on any of these three treasures, but remember that each gamble costs you one point. If you guess correctly, you get your point back plus the points for the treasure. However, if you guess incorrectly, you lose the point and the treasure.

There are two ways to gamble in Pyramid King. You can either bet on which tile will be uncovered next or which color will be uncovered next. To bet on a tile, simply enter the number of the tile on the pyramid where you want to bet. For example, if there are 5 tiles left and you want to bet on the 2nd tile from the left, type 2 into the text box. If you want to bet on the color red, type r into the text box.

To make things more interesting, I have also added a bonus payout for every 10th gamble. So make sure to Gamble often!

That's all for now folks! Make sure to check out Pyramid King during these 3 days and good luck in becoming the Pyramid King!
