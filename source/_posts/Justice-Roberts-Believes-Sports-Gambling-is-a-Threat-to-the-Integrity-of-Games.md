#  Justice Roberts Believes Sports Gambling is a Threat to the Integrity of Games

Justice John Roberts, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, said that sports gambling is a threat to the integrity of games. He was in support of the federal ban on sports gambling. This was in direct contradiction to the majority’s ruling that the ban was unconstitutional.

Roberts stated that the professional and amateur sports leagues have a legitimate interest in ensuring that the “integrity and public confidence in sport are protected.” He emphasized that the legalization of sports gambling would increase the likelihood of game-fixing scandals.

Roberts also argued that the legalization of sports gambling would hurt state economies. He pointed out that Nevada, which has legalized sports gambling, derives only 2% of its revenue from it. In contrast, he noted that Mississippi, which has not legalized sports gambling, derives 15% of its revenue from it.

Chief Justice Roberts’ dissent is a strong argument against the legalization of sports gambling.

#  Supreme Court Justice Breyer Expresses Concerns About Sports Gambling

On Monday, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer voiced his concerns about the expansion of sports gambling. He believes that it could have a negative impact on the integrity of sports.

Breyer's comments come as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case on the legality of sports betting. The case, which will be heard in December, centers around whether or not the federal law that bans sports betting is constitutional.

New Jersey is arguing that the law is unconstitutional and should be overturned. If the Supreme Court agrees with New Jersey, it could pave the way for other states to legalize sports betting.

Justice Breyer has not yet announced how he plans to vote in the case, but his comments are a sign that he is skeptical of legalizing sports gambling.

#  Justice Thomas Rejects Sports Betting on Moral Grounds

Justice Clarence Thomas, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said he could not agree that the Constitution permits such a “blatant and aggressive” violation of state sovereignty.

“The majority practically bends over backward to ensure that sports gambling will be available on every street corner in America,” he wrote.

He also objected to the way the case was decided, without full briefing and argument. The majority did not even wait for the filing of briefs in the case by the Trump administration or Congress, he wrote.

“I am not sure whether I should applaud or be appalled,” he said.

Justices John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan joined in the opinion that struck down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited most state-authorized sports gambling.

It is my belief that sports betting is immoral and should not be protected under our Constitution. I am grateful to have Justice Clarence Thomas along side me in this dissent. The majority of the Court does not seem to share this belief, instead siding with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy in permitting this blatant and aggressive violation of state sovereignty. This will undoubtedly pave the way for other states to legalize sports betting and create an even bigger black market for gambling. Not only do I believe that sports betting is immoral, I also believe that it is bad for our society and economy as a whole. It harms families, creates addictions, and takes money away from more productive economic endeavors

#  Chief Justice Roberts Joins Justices in Voting Against Sports Betting

The Supreme Court on Monday ruled against New Jersey in its effort to legalize sports betting, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court’s four more conservative members.

The 6-3 ruling was a defeat for New Jersey and other states that have been seeking to legalize sports betting as a way to bolster state finances.

New Jersey had argued that the federal law prohibiting most sports betting violated the Constitution’s 10th Amendment, which says that powers not specifically given to the federal government belong to the states.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, joined by the other four conservatives: Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.

#  SCOTUS Votes 7-2 Against New Jersey's Effort to Legalize Sports Betting

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court upheld a 26-year-old law that bans sports betting in most states. The law was challenged by New Jersey, which sought to legalize sports betting in order to help its struggling casinos and racetracks.

In a 7-2 ruling, the court held that the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) does not violate the Constitution. The law prohibits state governments from authorizing or licensing sports betting schemes.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, and Elena Kagan.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch.

New Jersey had argued that PASPA violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which reserves power to the states. But the majority ruled that Congress had authority to regulate gambling under the Commerce Clause.

“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make," Roberts wrote. "Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own."

New Jersey also argued that PASPA violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates against states that want to legalize sports betting. But again, the majority ruled against New Jersey, finding that PASPA did not treat states differently and was instead a regulation of interstate commerce.

Monday's ruling was a major setback for New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and other supporters of legalized sports betting. Murphy had called legalized sports betting “a jobs creator and an economic engine." He said he would continue to push for its legalization.
