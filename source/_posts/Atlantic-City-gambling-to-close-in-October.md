#  Atlantic City gambling to close in October

Atlantic City gambling is scheduled to close in October after suffering years of losses. The casino closures are planned to start on October 10th and will continue through the 14th. This will leave the city with only three casinos remaining open, which is not enough to keep the city afloat.

Atlantic City gambling first opened in 1978, and it was once a popular spot for those looking to gamble and enjoy the ocean views. However, over the years the city has suffered from competition from other states that have legalized gambling, as well as from online gambling. This has led to a decline in revenue for Atlantic City, which in turn has led to casino closures.

The most recent closure was Trump Taj Mahal, which shut down in October 2016. That left Atlantic City with only eight casinos, but this number continued to dwindle as more and more closed their doors. Now there are only three casinos remaining: Borgata, Caesars, and Golden Nugget.

These three casinos are fighting for survival, and they have all been cutting costs in order to stay afloat. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult as competition continues to increase. In fact, Caesars recently announced that it will be closing its Harrah’s Philadelphia casino due to increased competition in that area.

It is clear that Atlantic City gambling is no longer a viable option for casinos. The closures this month are just the beginning, and it is likely that more casinos will close in the future.

#  Atlantic City gambling shutting down for good

Atlantic City, the seaside gambling resort that has hosted millions of visitors and generated billions of dollars in revenue over the years, will soon be history. The Atlantic Club shut down in January, followed by the Showboat in August and the Revel in September.

The impending closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is merely the latest evidence that Atlantic City’s glory days are a thing of the past. The city is facing growing competition from casinos in other states, and its customers are increasingly choosing to gamble online instead.

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian admits that things have not gone as planned. “It was a shock to all of us that three casinos closed this year,” he said. “We didn’t think it would happen, but it did. It just shows you how quickly things can change in this industry.”

Guardian remains upbeat about Atlantic City’s future, but many economists and industry experts are not so sure. They argue that the city’s decline is inevitable and that its best days are behind it.

#  Atlantic City casino closures could mean $1B in lost revenue

Atlantic City is bracing for the loss of four more casino closures this year, which is expected to lead to a revenue loss of $1 billion.

The casinos that are set to close are the Trump Taj Mahal, the Showboat, the Revel, and the Trump Plaza. This will leave Atlantic City with 8 casinos in operation.

The closings will result in nearly 4000 job losses, and this comes at a time when Atlantic City is already struggling with high levels of unemployment.

Atlantic City's gaming industry has taken a hit in recent years as neighboring states have opened up their own casinos. This has resulted in a decline in gambling revenues for Atlantic City.

In an effort to combat this decline, Atlantic City has been trying to increase its non-gambling offerings, such as retail and hotel space. But these efforts have not been enough to offset the losses from the casino closures.

#  Atlantic City casinos closing: A blessing in disguise?

Atlantic City's casino industry is in trouble. In the last two years, five of the twelve casinos in the city have closed, and more are expected to close in the coming year. The main culprits are decreased demand due to competition from casinos in other states, and increased regulation of the industry.

The closures have led to layoffs and economic hardship for many in the city. But could this be a blessing in disguise?

Atlantic City was once known as "the gambling capital of the world." But its monopoly on gambling has been eroded by casinos opened in other states. And with increasing regulation of the casino industry, it is becoming harder and harder for Atlantic City casinos to turn a profit.

The closures may be a sign that the casino industry is no longer viable in Atlantic City. This could pave the way for a new, more sustainable economy to develop in the city.

One possible avenue for redevelopment is tourism. Atlantic City could focus on its many other attractions, such as its beaches, boardwalk, and restaurants. This would be more sustainable than relying on casino revenue, which is cyclical and vulnerable to fluctuations in the economy.

Another possibility is redevelopment into a residential area. With so many homes vacant due to casino closures, there is potential forAtlantic City to become a commuter town for New York City or Philadelphia. This would provide much-needed housing stock and stimulate the local economy.

The closure of some of Atlantic City's casinos may be a bad thing for those who are losing their jobs or struggling economically. But it could be a good thing for the city as a whole. It may be time for Atlantic City to reinvent itself and find a new identity

#  Atlantic City gambling to close by September

The once-popular Atlantic City gambling scene is quickly deteriorating, with five of the 12 casinos planning to close their doors by September. The closures will leave thousands of people unemployed and bring in much less tax revenue for the state.

Atlantic City was once the go-to spot for gambling, but it has been in decline for years as other states have legalized gaming. Low-cost competition from places like Pennsylvania and New Jersey has taken a toll on Atlantic City's casino revenues, which have fallen from $5.2 billion in 2006 to $2.48 billion last year.

The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel was the first to close its doors in January 2014, and Revel Casino Hotel followed suit in August 2014. The Showboat Casino Hotel closed in August 2014, the Trump Plaza Casino Hotel closed in September 2014, and the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort is scheduled to close in October 2016.

These closures will leave thousands of people out of work and devastate the state's economy. Atlantic City currently employs about 34,000 people, but that number is expected to fall to about 17,000 after all the casinos close. The closures are also expected to bring in much less tax revenue for New Jersey; casino taxes accounted for 7 percent of the state's total budget revenue in 2013, but that number is expected to fall to 2 percent after the closures.

Atlantic City has tried to diversify its economy by attracting new businesses and developing tourism infrastructure, but those efforts have not been enough to offset the loss of gambling revenue. The city may need to consider additional measures - such as legalizing online gambling - if it wants to avoid continued decline.
