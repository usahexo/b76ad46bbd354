<p>The previous record was $4.9 million, won by a woman in Atlantic City in 2013. </p>
<p>“It still hasn’t really sunk in,” the truck driver said of his windfall. “I just can’t believe it.” </p>
<p>The lucky winner was playing a penny slot machine called “Full Moon Fiesta” when the winning symbols lined up. After realizing he had just become a millionaire, the man selflessly asked casino staff to call his wife and share the good news with her. </p>
<p>“She was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ And I said, ‘No, I’m not kidding,’” he recounted later. </p>
<p>The truck driver is already thinking about what to do with his new-found wealth, and is considering buying a new house and spending time with his family. </p>
<p>“It feels good,” he said of his winnings. “Really good.”</p>

<h1 id="Expert-Tips-For-Playing-Online-Winstar-Casino"><a href="#Expert-Tips-For-Playing-Online-Winstar-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Expert Tips For Playing Online Winstar Casino"></a>Expert Tips For Playing Online Winstar Casino</h1><p>Are you looking for some expert tips for playing online Winstar casino? You’ve come to the right place! Here we will share with you some of the best insider tips that will help you on your way to becoming a online casino Winstar pro.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the Right Game</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step to becoming a successful online Winstar casino player is to choose the right game. Not every game is created equal and some games are better suited for certain players than others. Do your research and find the game that best suits your style and your bankroll.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t Chase Your Losses</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes players make is chasing their losses. When you start losing money, it can be tempting to keep betting in order to try and win it back, but this is never a good idea. Chasing your losses will only lead to bigger losses in the long run. Step away from the table and take a break until you are feeling more confident.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Gamble Responsibly</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling should always be done responsibly – never gamble more than you can afford to lose. Keep in mind that gambling is meant for entertainment purposes only and should not be used as a means to make ends meet. If you find yourself struggling financially, it is time to stop gambling altogether.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Stay Patient and Consistent</li>
</ol>
<p>Successful casino players are those who are patient and consistent. They don’t get too carried away when they are winning nor do they get too down when they are losing. They stay calm and methodical, making strategic decisions that give them the best chance of winning in the long run. This type of approach takes time and patience, but it is well worth it in the end.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Use Bonuses Wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Casino bonuses can be a great way to boost your bankroll, but it is important to use them wisely. Never gamble with bonus money if you cannot afford to lose it – these funds should only be used for playing on games that have a lower house edge so that you can increase your chances of winning real money payouts.</p>
<h1 id="Discover-The-Best-Way-To-Play-amp-Win-At-The-Winstar-Casino"><a href="#Discover-The-Best-Way-To-Play-amp-Win-At-The-Winstar-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Discover The Best Way To Play &amp; Win At The Winstar Casino"></a>Discover The Best Way To Play &amp; Win At The Winstar Casino</h1><p>The Winstar Casino is a popular casino and resort located in Thackerville, Oklahoma. It is owned by the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. The casino has over 100,000 square feet of gaming space that includes more than 7,000 electronic games, table games, and a simulcast area. There are also several restaurants on site as well as a hotel with nearly 400 rooms. </p>
<p>If you’re looking to try your luck at the Winstar Casino, there are a few things you should know first. In this article, we’ll discuss the best way to play and win at the casino. We’ll also cover some of the most popular games played there and offer some tips for how to increase your chances of winning. </p>
<p>When it comes to playing at the Winstar Casino, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, make sure you familiarize yourself with the games offered at the casino before playing. There is a huge variety of games available, so make sure you choose one that you are comfortable with. You’ll also want to read the game rules carefully so you understand the betting procedures and what payout you can expect if you win. </p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when playing at the Winstar Casino is your bankroll. Make sure you have enough money set aside to cover your bets. It’s never a good idea to gamble more than you can afford to lose. Also, be aware of the casino’s betting limits - some games have higher minimums and maximums than others. </p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered some of the basics, let’s discuss some of the most popular games played at the Winstar Casino. The first game we’ll look at is slots. Slots are one of the easiest games to play and they offer some of the best odds for players. Most slots machines have a payout percentage of between 95% and 99%. This means that for every $100 wagered on slots, players can expect to receive between $95 and $99 back in return (excluding any wins). So, if you’re looking for a game with good odds, slots are definitely worth considering. </p>
<p>Another popular game at the Winstar Casino is blackjack. Blackjack is a card game that involves making bets against the dealer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (the ace can count as either 1 or 11). Players can beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than he does or by having him bust (go over 21). Blackjack offers some pretty good odds for players - especially if they use basic strategy techniques. In fact, blackjack has one of the lowest house edges of any casino game - just 0.5%. </p>
<p>If you’re looking for something with even better odds, consider playing craps instead of blackjack. Craps has a house edge of just 1%, making it one of the best bets in the casino! The only downside is that craps can be a bit complicated for beginners - so it’s recommended that new players start out by playing simpler games like slots or blackjack first. </p>
<p>So now that you know about some of the best games to play at the Winstar Casino, let’s talk about how to increase your chances of winning! One simple tip is to always bet within your budget - don’t gamble more money than you can afford to lose. This will help reduce your stress levels and ensure that you enjoy your time at the casino without risking any serious financial consequences Later on if lady luck happens smile upon then all profit gained goes safely into pocket without any worries however do not go overboard on spending when initially starting out!   Another thing you can do is take advantage of casino bonuses offered by Some casinos will offer new players sign up bonuses which gives them extra money free To play with! Take advantage while these offers last because they usually don’t last long Players who frequent casinos regularly often get benefits like free meals or discounted room rates Be sure ask what type incentives offered current members before splurging Thing Finally remember have fun while gambling If achieve satisfactory results but happen walk away empty handed remember not everything revolves around money life still goes on outside inside casinos! So go enjoy other aspects life offers cowboy up!</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Improve-Your-Chances-of-Winning-at-the-Winstar-Casino"><a href="#How-To-Improve-Your-Chances-of-Winning-at-the-Winstar-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How To Improve Your Chances of Winning at the Winstar Casino"></a>How To Improve Your Chances of Winning at the Winstar Casino</h1><p>There are a few tips to keep in mind when you head to the Winstar Casino in Oklahoma. The first is to know your limit and to stick to it. If you’re going to gamble, only gamble what you can afford to lose. Second, be sure to visit the casino’s website and check out the promotions page before heading out. You might be able to take advantage of some freebies or discounts while you’re there. Finally, dress for success! You’re more likely to have a good time if you feel confident and look your best.</p>
<p>It’s also important to do your research before playing any games. Blackjack, for example, is one of the best games to play at the casino because it has a low house edge if you know how to play properly. Roulette is another game with a lower house edge than many others; just be sure not to bet on red or black every time! Craps can be tricky, but it’s also one of the most lucrative games if you make smart bets. And finally, slot machines are always popular with casino-goers - just remember that the house edge is pretty high on these so it’s important not to bet too much.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling nervous about hitting the casino, there are some things you can do to help boost your confidence. Practice at home with some fake money so you feel more comfortable with the games. And remember, it’s all about having fun - even if you don’t end up winning big bucks, it’s still a great experience!</p>

<p>Finally, after almost two weeks of complaints and frustration, Red Hawk Casino announced that they had found a solution to the gift download issue. In a post on their website, the casino stated that all players who had been affected would be able to redeem their gifts without any problems.</p>
<p>While this announcement was welcomed by most players, some still felt that they had been given a raw deal. After all, they’d been unable to use or redeem their gifts for almost two weeks! Nevertheless, most people were relieved that the issue had finally been resolved.</p>
<p>So if you’re planning on visiting Red Hawk Casino in the near future, be sure to take advantage of their great gift download offer – just make sure you don’t run into any problems redeeming it!</p>

If you’re one of those people, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>There are a few different places that you can buy tickets from, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. We’ll take a look at each of them and help you decide which is the best option for you.</p>
<p>First up, there’s the official ticketing website for the event. This is probably your best bet if you want to be sure that your tickets are legitimate and will get you into the show. The website offers both online and physical ticket purchases, so you can choose the method that works best for you.</p>
<p>However, there is a catch: tickets are quite expensive on the official website. You’ll end up paying a significant markup if you buy them through the site, so it might not be worth it unless you really want to see the show and don’t mind spending some extra money.</p>
<p>If affordability is your top priority, then your next best option is to buy tickets from secondary sellers. There are lots of different websites and marketplaces where you can find tickets at a fraction of the price offered on the official website. Just be careful to make sure that you’re buying from a reputable source – otherwise, you might end up with fake tickets that won’t get you into the show.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re looking to save even more money on tickets, then consider buying them from locals in Saudi Arabia. This can be a bit risky, as there’s no guarantee that the tickets will actually be valid, but it’s definitely worth a try if you’re on a tight budget.</p>
<p>So, now that you know all about where to buy tickets for the upcoming artist casino pre-sale in Saudi Arabia, it’s time to make your decision! We suggest checking out all of your options and deciding which one gives you the best value for your money</p>

        <h1 id="Get-Ready-to-Claim-Your-Casino-Tax-Deductions"><a href="#Get-Ready-to-Claim-Your-Casino-Tax-Deductions" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready to Claim Your Casino Tax Deductions!"></a>Get Ready to Claim Your Casino Tax Deductions!</h1><p>Are you a regular at your local casino? If so, you may be able to claim some valuable tax deductions. Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Casino Tax Deductions: The Basics</p>
<p>First things first: you can only claim casino tax deductions if they are associated with gambling losses. In other words, you can only deduct expenses that are related to losing bets. This includes things like travel expenses, hotel costs, and even food and beverage costs.</p>
<p>However, there are a few important things to keep in mind. First, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you won $1,000 at the casino but lost $1,500, you can only deduct $1,000 worth of losses. Second, you can only claim deductions for expenses that were incurred during the year in which you claimed the losses. Finally, your total deduction for gambling losses cannot exceed the amount of taxable income you report for the year.</p>
<p>How to Claim Casino Tax Deductions</p>
<p>So how do you go about claiming casino tax deductions? It’s actually pretty simple. All you need to do is complete Form 1040 Schedule A (Itemized Deductions). This form allows you to list all of your eligible deductions, including those related to gambling losses. Simply enter the amount of your losses on Line 28 and be sure to check the “Yes” box next to “Gambling Losses” on Line 29b.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Schedule A is used to calculate your total itemized deductions; it is not used to determine whether or not you are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). So even if your itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction amount ($6,300 for singles and $12,600 for married couples filing jointly in 2019), you may still have to pay the AMT if it results in a larger tax bill.</p>
<p>Can You Deduct Casino Travel Expenses?</p>
<p>If you frequently travel to casinos in order to gamble, you may be able to deduct some of your travel expenses as well. For example, expenses like airfare, train tickets, rental car costs, and hotel room charges can all be deducted as long as they are related specifically to gambling activities. However, there are a few restrictions worth noting. First, deductible travel expenses must exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year. Second, only those travel costs that are above your normal daily commute qualify for deduction purposes. Finally, transportation costs between your home and casino cannot be deducted – even if they exceed 2% of AGI. So essentially, only out-of-town gambling trips qualify for deduction purposes.</p>
<p>Can You Deduct Casino Meal Expenses?</p>
<p>If you like to enjoy a meal or two while playing at the casino table games or slots machines, don’t forget that these costs can also be deducted as gambling-related expenses! In fact, just about any food or drink expense incurred while gambling can be written off – including tips! Just be sure that all documentation is kept in case the IRS ever asks for proof. Again however there are some restrictions: deductible meal expenses must exceed 50% of AGI and they must be associated with specific instances of gambling activity (not just general trip spending).</p>
<h1 id="What-Types-of-Casino-Tax-Deductions-Are-Available-to-Me"><a href="#What-Types-of-Casino-Tax-Deductions-Are-Available-to-Me" class="headerlink" title="What Types of Casino Tax Deductions Are Available to Me?"></a>What Types of Casino Tax Deductions Are Available to Me?</h1><p>Casino tax deductions are available to both individuals and businesses. Generally, these deductions are available for expenses incurred in connection with the casino-related activity. However, there are some exceptions.</p>
<p>Individuals can generally deduct casino-related expenses on their federal income tax return. For example, you may be able to deduct the cost of travel to and from the casino, as well as your lodging and food expenses while at the casino. In addition, you may be able to deduct losses from your casino gambling activities.</p>
<p>Businesses can also deduct casino-related expenses on their federal income tax return. For example, a business can deduct the cost of travel to and from the casino, as well as its lodging and food expenses while at the casino. In addition, businesses can generally deduct any losses from their casino gambling activities.</p>
<p>There are a few important things to keep in mind when claiming deductions for casino-related expenses. First, you must be able to show that the expense was incurred in connection with your gambling activity. Additionally, you must itemize your deductions on your federal income tax return in order to claim these deductions.</p>

<h1 id="How-Do-I-Claim-My-Casino-Tax-Deduction"><a href="#How-Do-I-Claim-My-Casino-Tax-Deduction" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Claim My Casino Tax Deduction?"></a>How Do I Claim My Casino Tax Deduction?</h1><p>When you gamble, there are certain deductions you can take on your taxes. These deductions can help to lower your taxable income, and in turn, reduce the amount of taxes you owe. If you’re wondering how to claim your casino tax deduction, read on for more information.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is calculate your gambling losses for the year. To do this, add up all of your gambling losses for the year, including money lost on bets, slot machines, lotteries and any other form of gambling. Then subtract this amount from your gambling winnings. This will give you your net gambling loss for the year.</p>
<p>Now that you have this figure, you can deduct it from your taxable income. This will lower your taxable income and save you money on your taxes. Be sure to keep track of all of your gambling receipts and records so that you can accurately calculate your losses and deductions.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to claim your casino tax deduction, or if you need help filing your taxes, be sure to consult with a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="What-If-I-Don’t-Have-Any-Receipts-or-Records-of-My-Winnings"><a href="#What-If-I-Don’t-Have-Any-Receipts-or-Records-of-My-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="What If I Don’t Have Any Receipts or Records of My Winnings?"></a>What If I Don’t Have Any Receipts or Records of My Winnings?</h1><p>If you don’t have any receipts or records of your winnings, the best thing to do is to Contact the IRS. Explain to them that you didn’t keep any records of your gambling winnings and ask them how you should proceed.</p>
<p>The IRS may require you to provide some information in order to determine whether or not you actually won money. They may ask for things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of the dates and times you gambled</li>
<li>The name of the casino or other venue where you gambled</li>
<li>The amount of money you won</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Is-There-a-Limit-to-the-Amount-of-My-Casino-Tax-Deduction"><a href="#Is-There-a-Limit-to-the-Amount-of-My-Casino-Tax-Deduction" class="headerlink" title="Is There a Limit to the Amount of My Casino Tax Deduction?"></a>Is There a Limit to the Amount of My Casino Tax Deduction?</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service has been clear about one thing when it comes to gambling losses: They are deductible. But just how much of your gambling losses can you write off on your taxes?</p>
<p>That’s a question that has taxed many a taxpayer over the years. The answer, unfortunately, is not as straightforward as you might hope.</p>
<p>To understand how much of your gambling losses you can deduct, you need to understand the difference between ordinary and capital losses. Ordinary losses are those incurred in the course of your regular trade or business. These can be deducted from your income in full.</p>
<p>Capital losses, on the other hand, are realized when you sell or dispose of assets – such as stocks or bonds – for less than their original cost. These can be used to offset capital gains, but only up to $3,000 per year. Any excess capital losses can be carried forward to future tax years.</p>
<p>So, how does this apply to gambling losses? Gambling activities are considered a personal investment, not a business investment. This means that your gambling losses are considered capital losses and are subject to the $3,000 per year limit. However, any excess can be carried forward and used in future years if necessary.</p>

This exciting card game is easy to play and can keep you entertained for hours on end.</p>
<p>Baccarat originated in Italy in the 15th century and has been enjoyed by players all over the world ever since. The aim of the game is to guess which hand (the player’s or the banker’s) will be closest to nine when the cards are counted. In addition, there are many betting options available which makes the game even more exciting.</p>
<p>The CA6 baccarat game is played with eight decks of cards which are shuffled and placed in the shoe. The player is then given two cards and the banker is given two cards. The total of both cards is then shown, with Ace counting as one and a picture card counting as zero. If either the player or banker has an eight or nine, this is known as a ‘natural’ and no further cards are drawn.</p>
<p>If neither player nor banker has an eight or nine, then one more card is drawn for each hand. The highest total wins – unless one side has a natural, in which case they automatically win. In addition, if either the player or banker has a five or less, they can opt to take another card instead of standing.</p>
<p>The CA6 baccarat game offers many different betting options, including betting on whether either hand will get as close to nine as possible (called a ‘tie’ bet), betting on which hand will win (player or banker), and betting on whether there will be a tie. There are also several other exotic bets available which can add excitement to the game.</p>
<p>If you want to enjoy some excitement without risking too much money, then give CA6 baccarat a try – you won’t be disappointed!</p>

One of the key attractions of CA6 baccarat is that there is no drinking or gambling involved – making it perfect for those who are looking for a more relaxed gaming experience.</p>
<p>The objective of CA6 baccarat is to get as close to 9 as possible, with players betting on whether they think the player or banker hand will be closer to 9. If both hands are equal, the “tie” bet pays out 8:1.</p>
<p>One of the great things about CA6 baccarat is that the rules are very easy to follow, even for beginners. The game moves quickly, so you won’t have to wait long to find out if you’ve won or lost.

<p>How does CA6 work?</p>
<p>The basic premise of CA6 is very simple: you just have to place bets on either the Player or the Banker, and then watch the cards being dealt. The aim of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible, and the winner is the person who has the highest total score. If both players have the same score, then it’s called a “push” and no one wins.</p>
<p>One thing that makes CA6 particularly interesting is that players can also choose to bet on a tie. This increases your chances of winning, but it also means that your final payout will be lower if you do happen to win.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of playing CA6?</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons why you should try out CA6 baccarat game play, including:</p>
<p>· It’s easy to learn how to play – even if you’ve never played baccarat before, you’ll be able to understand how to play CA6 in no time at all.</p>

<p>· The odds are very generous, which means that you have a good chance of winning money even if your bets are relatively small.</p>
<p>· The graphics and sound effects are realistic and engaging, making for an immersive gaming experience.</p>

        <h1 id="Tax-experts-weigh-in-on-the-duty-rate-for-casino-winnings"><a href="#Tax-experts-weigh-in-on-the-duty-rate-for-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Tax experts weigh in on the duty rate for casino winnings"></a>Tax experts weigh in on the duty rate for casino winnings</h1><p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has released its proposed revised gaming duty rates for casino winnings, and there is much speculation on what the new tax rates will be.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a lot of information yet,” says accountant Sean Fayad. “But it’s clear that the CRA is trying to reduce the amount of tax avoidance associated with gambling.”</p>
<p>The CRA has not released any details on the proposed changes, but speculation is that the new rate for casino winnings will be in the range of 15-25%.</p>
<p>“It’s important to remember that these are just proposals at this point,” notes Fayad. “And there will be a lot of discussion and debate before anything is finalized.”</p>
<p>Many experts are urging Canadians to speak up and share their thoughts on the proposed changes.</p>
<p>“This is a huge change, and it’s going to affect a lot of people,” says accounting professor Cynthia Koot. “We need to make sure that we get it right.”</p>
<h1 id="Canada-Revenue-Agency-releases-guidance-on-the-treatment-of-casino-winnings"><a href="#Canada-Revenue-Agency-releases-guidance-on-the-treatment-of-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Canada Revenue Agency releases guidance on the treatment of casino winnings"></a>Canada Revenue Agency releases guidance on the treatment of casino winnings</h1><p>On October 3, 2017, the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) released guidance on the tax treatment of casino winnings (the “Guidance”). The Guidance supersedes prior interpretations issued by the CRA in respect of the taxation of casino winnings, and provides clarity on a number of key issues.</p>
<p>The first issue addressed by the Guidance is the characterization of casino winnings as taxable either as income or capital gains. The CRA confirmed that all Casino winnings are taxable as income, with no exceptions. This is consistent with the CRA’s previously stated position that all gambling income is included in income for tax purposes.</p>
<p>The Guidance also provides clarity on when taxpayers are required to report their casino winnings. Generally, taxpayers must report their casino winnings in the year in which they are received. However, where a taxpayer incurs gambling losses in the same year as their casino wins, they are entitled to deduct those losses from their gross income to arrive at their net gambling income for tax purposes. This deduction is available whether or not the taxpayer reports their winnings on their tax return.</p>
<p>In addition to clarifying when taxpayers are required to report their casino winnings, the Guidance also provides guidance on how to calculate those winnings for tax purposes. In particular, it outlines how to calculate gross revenue (i.e., total amount wagered minus total amount paid back to players), net revenue (gross revenue minus allowable expenses), and taxable income (net revenue minus personal exemptions and deductions). The CRA has also released a new worksheet titled “Casino Winnings Tax Calculation” which taxpayers can use to calculate their taxable income from casino winnings.</p>
<p>Finally, the Guidance addresses a number of other issues related to the taxation of casino winnings, including what constitutes an allowable expense, foreign currency exchange rates, and late filing penalties and interest charges.</p>
<h1 id="Are-you-paying-too-much-tax-on-your-casino-winnings"><a href="#Are-you-paying-too-much-tax-on-your-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Are you paying too much tax on your casino winnings?"></a>Are you paying too much tax on your casino winnings?</h1><p>Casino winnings are considered taxable income in most countries around the world. This means that, no matter how much you win, you will have to pay tax on it. In some cases, the amount of tax you have to pay can be quite large, leaving you with a reduced amount of money from your winnings.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are ways to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay on your casino winnings. One way is to claim your gambling losses as a deduction against your winnings. This can significantly reduce the amount of tax you have to pay.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay is by choosing a casino that is located in a country with low taxes. Gibraltar and Malta are two examples of countries with low taxes on casino winnings. By playing at a casino in one of these countries, you can reduce the amount of tax you have to pay on your winnings.</p>
<p>If you want to take things one step further, you can create a company that operates as a casino in one of these countries. By doing this, you can take advantage of even lower taxes on casino winnings. This can be a great way to keep more of your money after winning at the casino.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay on your casino winnings. By using one or more of these methods, you can keep more of your hard-earned money in your pocket.</p>
<h1 id="New-report-sheds-light-on-the-tax-treatment-of-casino-winnings-in-Canada"><a href="#New-report-sheds-light-on-the-tax-treatment-of-casino-winnings-in-Canada" class="headerlink" title="New report sheds light on the tax treatment of casino winnings in Canada"></a>New report sheds light on the tax treatment of casino winnings in Canada</h1><p>A new report from the Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF) has shed light on the tax treatment of casino winnings in Canada. According to the report, taxpayers who win more than $1,000 at a casino are required to pay tax on their winnings, even if they don’t receive any money.</p>
<p>“Canadian taxpayers are being unfairly targeted by the CRA when it comes to gambling income,” said CTF Federal Director Aaron Wudrick. “The rules governing casino wins are draconian and out-of-touch with reality.”</p>
<p>Wudrick noted that the tax rules for casino winnings are different than those for other forms of gambling, such as lotteries and online gambling. For example, taxpayers who win more than $500 playing the lottery or online gambling are not required to pay tax on their winnings.</p>
<p>“The fact that someone who wins a jackpot at a casino can be taxed on their good luck while someone who wins the same amount playing slots in an online casino is not taxed is simply ridiculous,” said Wudrick.</p>
<p>The CTF report also notes that many taxpayers are unaware of the tax rules for casino winnings, and that the CRA has been increasingly cracking down on people who don’t report their winnings. In 2017, the CRA collected nearly $17 million in taxes from individuals who won more than $1,000 at a casino.</p>
<p>Wudrick called on the federal government to reform the rules for taxing casino winnings, saying that they are unfair and out-of-date. “It’s time for Ottawa to treat Canadians fairly when it comes to gambling income,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Get-the-latest-news-on-the-duty-rate-for-casino-winnings"><a href="#Get-the-latest-news-on-the-duty-rate-for-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Get the latest news on the duty rate for casino winnings"></a>Get the latest news on the duty rate for casino winnings</h1><p>Casino winnings are currently subject to a 33 percent duty rate. However, this may change in the near future.</p>
<p>The government is currently considering a proposal that would reduce the duty rate on casino winnings to 20 percent. This would be a welcome change for casino players, who have long complained about the high duty rate.</p>
<p>If the proposal is approved, it is likely that the duty rate will be reduced in early 2019. This means that players will need to keep an eye on the latest news to ensure they pay the correct amount of tax.</p>
<p>In addition to the proposed reduction in the duty rate, there are also rumours that the government may abolish the duty altogether. This would be a major victory for casino players, and it is something that they should keep an eye on in the coming months.</p>
<p>It is important to note that any changes to the duty rate are still subject to approval by parliament. However, with casino winnings generating millions of dollars in tax revenue each year, it is likely that any proposed changes will be given serious consideration by lawmakers.</p>
