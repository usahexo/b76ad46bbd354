#  Oneill Talks about the Hard Rock Casino Polk and how Excited he is for it!

As an avid gambler and fan of the Hard Rock brand, I’m excited for the new Hard Rock casino in Polk County, Florida. This will be the company’s sixth casino location in Floria and is scheduled to open in 2018.

The new casino will be located on Highway 27, just minutes away from Disney World. It will feature a hotel, a concert hall, several restaurants, and of course, a large casino floor with all of your favorite games.

I had a chance to speak with company executives about the new casino and they told me that they are planning on making it one of the most luxurious casinos in the state. They are investing $500 million into the project and promise that it will be a “must-see” attraction for tourists and locals alike.

For me, this is great news. Not only am I looking forward to playing some slots and table games at the Hard Rock casino Polk County, but I’m also excited about its potential to boost tourism in the area.

Disney World is already one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and with a new Hard Rock casino just minutes away, I believe that Polk County is going to see a surge in visitors. This is great news for local businesses and for the economy as a whole.

I can’t wait to see how things play out when the new Hard Rock casino opens next year!
