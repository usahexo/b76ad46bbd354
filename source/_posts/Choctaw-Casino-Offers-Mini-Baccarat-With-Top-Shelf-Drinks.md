#  What To Drink: Cocktails, Beer, Or Wine?

When it comes to social gatherings, there is often a debate about what to drink. Cocktails, beer, or wine? Each has its own unique benefits and drawbacks that should be considered before making a decision.

Cocktails are a great option because they are customizable and can be tailored to the tastes of the individual. They also tend to be more flavorful than either beer or wine. However, cocktails can be expensive and may not be as well-rounded as other beverages options.

Beer is a great choice for those who want something that is filling and provides plenty of flavor. It is also one of the most affordable drink options available. However, some people find beer to be too heavy and not as tasty as other types of drinks.

Wine is often considered the most sophisticated choice when it comes to beverages. It has a wide range of flavors that can appeal to many different palates. Additionally, wine is often thought of as being healthier than other drink options. However, wine can be expensive depending on the variety that is chosen.
